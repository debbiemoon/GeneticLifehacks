# Inflammation and Depression: Genetic Links

Research over the past two decades clearly shows a **causal link between increased inflammatory markers and depression**.  
Theories about depression and anxiety have evolved, and researchers now recognize that mood issues can have multiple causes.  
For a significant percentage of people with mood disorders, **addressing inflammation as an underlying factor** may help resolve depression or anxiety.

## Inflammation-Driven Depression

Common characteristics include:

- Sleep problems  
- Tiredness and lack of energy  
- Changes in appetite  
- Anhedonia (*feeling like nothing matters*)

## Genetic Susceptibility

One way to determine if inflammation is a root cause of mood disorders is to look at **genetic variants** that increase susceptibility.

### TNF-alpha
- **TNF-alpha (tumor necrosis factor alpha)** is one of the bodyâ€™s primary inflammatory cytokines.  
- A 2008 genome-wide association study found that a **TNF genetic variant increases the risk of depression**.  
- High TNF-alpha levels may:
  - Impact the **HPA axis**, elevating cortisol (linked to depression).  
  - Increase **serotonin uptake into cells**, leading to depressive symptoms.  
([PMC4881555](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4881555/))

### IL-6
- **Interleukin-6 (IL-6)**, encoded by the *IL6* gene, is another inflammatory cytokine consistently elevated in depression.  
- Genetic studies show that higher IL-6 levels, combined with stressful life events, **increase the risk of depression**.
