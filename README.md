## 🎯 Purpose & Audience

My goal is to help readers:

- Understand how genetic variants influence inflammation, mood disorders, and metabolic health.  
- Use their raw genetic data (23andMe, AncestryDNA, etc.) as a tool to explore personalized research and interventions.  
- Access research-backed “lifehacks” tailored to their genotypes across many pathways.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Browse through the key articles above.  
2. If you have raw data, check out the **Raw Data Interpretation** guide.  
3. Dive into topics like inflammation, nutrigenomics, or LPA via their dedicated articles/folders.  
4. Bookmark or star this repo to follow updates and new research.
