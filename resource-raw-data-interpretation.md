# High Quality Resources for Genetic Raw Data
## Reports using 23andMe or AncestryDNA raw data 
**[Genetic Lifehacks](https://www.geneticlifehacks.com)**

Genetic Lifehacks helps users explore their raw data file (SNPs) using peer-reviewed studies. The in-depth articles explain how specific genetic variants (such as SNPs and gene mutations) can affect metabolism, nutrient needs, drug response, disease risk, and other health traits.
Users connect to their raw data file (local connection - not stored online for privacy) and see their genotypes in the articles, along with actionable health information.

## Research Resources 
[LitVar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Lu/Demo/LitVar)
Search for peer-reviewed research studies by entering the rs id on LitVar. This search engine will match the rs id (along with other ways of referring to the gene) to research studies that are available in PubMed.


[PubMed](https://www.pubmed.gov)
An NIH database of published research study abstracts.


[Google Scholar:](https://scholar.google.com/)
Use the power of Google to search through published studies The advantage here is that Google suggests other key words and corrects your spelling, but the drawback is that many studies are behind a paywall.


[Genetics Home Reference:](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/)
The GHR website is a great source for an overview of the function of a specific gene.


Biochemical Pathways:
This pathway plan (by Roche) is searchable by protein, enzyme, or cofactor.
