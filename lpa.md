**Key takeaways:**
* Lipoprotein(a) or Lp(a) is a cholesterol carrier.
* High Lp(a) levels are strongly linked to an increased risk of heart attacks and aortic stenosis.
* Genetic variants in the LPA gene drive Lpa(a) levels.
* Knowing that you are likely to have genetically higher Lp(a) can help you understand when it is important to test it and talk with a doctor.

[This Genetic Lifehacks article digs into research on lipoprotein (a)](https://www.geneticlifehacks.com/lipoproteina-a-big-genetic-risk-for-heart-disease/) and the genetic variants that can cause it to be elevated. It explains how to check your genetic raw data from 23andMe or AncestryDNA for common genetic causes of elevated lp(a).
